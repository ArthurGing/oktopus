This repository aims to promote the development of a multi-vendor management platform for IoTs. Any device that follows the TR-369 protocol can be managed. The form of communication with the IoT chosen for the project is MQTT. The main objective of the undertaking is to facilitate and unify device management, which generates countless benefits for the end user and service providers, extinguishes old problems in the telecommunications area and suppresses the demands that today's technologies require: device interconnection, data collection, speed, availability and much more.
</p>
<p>
With the creation of new technologies, it became necessary to create a more robust solution that covered a wider range of niches, so the TR-369 emerged, seeking to fill gaps in its predecessor (TR-069), which served its purpose well at the time, but now undergoes depreciation. With that in mind, we seek to bring an alternative to IT integrators, providers, system administrators, and others who may be interested.
</p> 
<p>
This solution is inspired by the project <a href="https://github.com/genieacs/genieacs">GenieACS</a> and other commercial solutions found on the market. We seek to strictly follow the specifications of USP TR-369, choosing to use MQTT in the MTP (Message Transfer Protocol) layer.
